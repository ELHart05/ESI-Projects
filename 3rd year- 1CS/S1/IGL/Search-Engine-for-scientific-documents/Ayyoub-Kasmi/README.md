- Description: The project is mainly about extracting specific text (e.g abstract, authors) from scientific articles (as PDFs), indexing it in an ElasticSearch database, and using an SQL database to store metadata about the PDF (e.g location/URL, owner...etc). The platform involves admins adding documents to the platform, reviewers who check the auto-generated result and fix mistakes like typos, and finally anonymous who can search for documents based on several criteria (e.g upload date, author, content) where ElasticSearch is heavily involved.
